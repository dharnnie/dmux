  # Review agents (role: review) are supported but not recommended.
  # A review agent uses the same model as the build agents, so it adds
  # cost and latency with limited independent value. Prefer reviewing
  # branches yourself in the main pane or running automated checks
  # (linting, tests) as part of the build agent command instead.
